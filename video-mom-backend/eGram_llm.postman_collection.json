We need your opinion on fixing the fine amount for this. Whether there is damage or not, there should be no trouble in the village. What I mean is that the village's security will be ensured. If anyone has any problem, they can raise it, and it will be resolved immediately by the Panchayat. Our Sarpanch Ji, the issue is that the drainage problem in our village, from the crossroads to Hari Om's house, needs to be resolved. This drain affects 70% of the village, and even walking there is difficult. Resolving this drain issue is the biggest problem. The condition of the village roads is also poor. We are trying to resolve this issue before the 30th. If anyone has any problem, they can send it as a voice recording. If you are at home, you can comfortably record your problem through voice and send it. The issues discussed today were raised by those who sent their problems via voice recording. We should not assume that this is an annual festival, that the Gram Sabha will happen only once, and all problems will be resolved on that day. Instead, keep sending your issues continuously and keep discussing them in the Gram Sabha. If we make this a continuous process, better results will be achieved. Amit Shukla, the founder of Sashakt Panchayat, will share his thoughts. To raise an issue, your face must be captured, meaning only voters of this village can raise their issues. Because before speaking about any problem, you must show your face. Issues will only be considered if the face is visible. If people have trouble typing or understanding the system, we have found two solutions. If you can speak, press the button on your mobile and record your problem by speaking. If you cannot press the button on your mobile, go to your ward member and ask them to submit your issue on your behalf. Ward members can also submit your problem. You do not need to wait for the Gram Sabha. You can submit your problem today in the evening, tomorrow, at night, during the day, or even on Sunday. The issues that were raised and those that were not discussed here, you will have to raise your voice. When you raise your voice, it will also be video recorded here. The issues we had will also be video recorded. Everything is being video recorded in this manner. After the video recording, the minutes that are created, detailing the decisions made, will now be generated by this software instead of being handwritten. It will show the key decisions made in today’s Gram Sabha. When you raised your hand a while ago, your consent was recorded. Therefore, this entire Gram Sabha has become digital. The minutes that will be created will also be digital. The Sarpanch will digitally sign them and upload them to the Government of India’s portal. Today’s Gram Sabha is India’s first fully digital Gram Sabha, where from issue registration to attendance, proceedings, and minutes, not a single piece of paper has been used. It is entirely digital. This is India’s first initiative. Thank you all very much, and special thanks to the Sarpanch for taking such a great initiative. If there is any problem, report it immediately, and it will be resolved promptly. If there is any complaint, its repair will be arranged. Facilities for bathrooms, including water and electricity, will be provided. A proposal will be prepared and sent to the concerned department, as this matter falls under the Women and Child Development Department. The Women and Child Development Department handles such matters, so we will send the proposal to them. The issue will be resolved promptly. We are sending proposals for the repair and maintenance of the building. A committee will be formed for village cleanliness, which will take responsibility for it. According to the Haryana Panchayat Raj Act, there is a provision for five or six standing committees. When society itself solves problems, most issues are resolved. For example, you resolved the issue related to eunuchs and cleanliness on your own. Similarly, committees can be formed for education and health, including ward members, teachers, parents, and community members. A committee should be formed, including a ward member and a female member. It is not necessary to be a ward member to join the committee; you can become a member if you are interested in the work and willing to take responsibility. This will not only benefit you socially but also enhance your political prestige. If you are interested in contesting elections, become a part of these committees. Additionally, a social security committee should be formed. As discussed by the PhD department today, a water management committee should be established. A land management committee should be formed for the use of grazing land, with the Patwari as the secretary and the Gram Pradhan as the chairperson. Members will be selected with the consent of the Gram Sabha. We have discussed the agenda today; now, a meeting should be held in the Gram Sabha. We have discussed the tax agenda in every way in the Gram Sabha today, there is no need to hold any more meetings now. A meeting has not been held yet in the Gram Sabha. Not now, have the meeting. Hold a meeting\"\r\n          }",
